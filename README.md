# Library Application

This is a simple library application built as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum. The app allows users to manage their personal library of books by adding, updating, and removing books.

## Features

- Add books to the library
- Display books in a grid or list format
- Update the read status of each book
- Remove books from the library
- Store book data in the browser's local storage (books persist after refreshing the page)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To use the Library application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start adding books to your library by clicking the "Add Book" button and filling out the book details.

## Future Improvements

- Add a search functionality to filter books by title or author.
- Integrate with a third-party API to automatically fetch book details when adding a book (e.g., Google Books API).
- Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their libraries separately.
